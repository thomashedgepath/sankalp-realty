            Cannabis in its most natural state. Cannabis flowers can either be smoked or used to create other products like concentrates or edibles. By far the most popular method for consuming cannabis is by smoking joints, bowls, or even vaping the flower directly. Cannabis comes in many different varieties, or "strains", all with different benefits and flavor profiles.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Different strains of flower usually fall into 3 categories:</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Sativa</strong>- These strains typically provide a more energizing effect, and provide increased creativity. Sativas often provide relief from anxiety and paranoia making them a good choice for parties or social occasions.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Indica</strong> - Indica strains are known for their full-body relaxation properties. These strains are great for muscle soreness, aches, pains, tension, and often work as a great sleep aid.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>Hybrid</strong> - Hybrids combine the best properties of both Indica and Sativa varieties of marijuana. Growers across the world have spent decades cross-breeding different strains to create high quality plants with the most desirable traits from both Indica and Sativa plants.

  //               Cannabis contains many different compounds that each have different effects on the body. The main two compounds you will see are THC and CBD. The two compounds have many of the same benefits with one key difference; THC gets you high, CBD does not. Many people find that CBD can provide the benefits of marijuana without the euphoric or dysphoric effects often introduced by products with higher THC.

                Concentrates are products made by processing cannabis plants in a way that extracts the desirable compounds (like cannabinoids and terpenes) from the plant. Concentrates come in many forms like wax, shatter, and oil. These products can be mixed with flower and smoked in standard bowls or joints, but are typically vaporized using 'dab rigs' or portable vaporizers. Concentrates are typically more potent than traditional flower and many smokers find concentrates to offer a cleaner more flavorful experience.

                Edible marijuana products have exploded in popularity in recent years. Edibles provide the same great benefits of other marijuana products without the need to smoke or vaporize flower or concentrates. These products come in a variety of products including baked goods, gummies, drinks, and infused cooking oil which can be used to add the benefits of marijuana to essentially any meal.

    When you're in a hurry there is nothing more convenient than a pre-rolled joint. 
</br>
</br>
Joints are one of the most popular forms of smoking marijuana. Many smokers choose joints as their go-to smoking method because they are cheap, can be easily stored and disposed of, and are easily shared among groups of people.
</br>
</br>
Rolling your own joints takes practice, and without a little time and patience you may end up spending more time cleaning up spilled weed than actually smoking. Save yourself the trouble and just grab a handful next time you're in the store.

    Vape cartridges offer a very portable and discrete way to 'smoke' at home or on-the-go. Pre-filled cartridges have become one of the most popular products on the market, and come in hundreds of different flavors and varieties.
    </br>
    </br>
    Pre-filled cartridges typically come in either 0.5g or 1.0g sizes and contain a highly potent oil with different combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes extracted from raw cannabis plants. Most of the cartridges you will find in stores come with a standard '510 threading' so they can be easily attached to any standard vape or e-cig battery.
    </br>
    </br>
    Using a vape cartridge and battery offers a consistent smoking experience for every puff and requires very little maintenance or cleaning. Just push the button and inhale.
